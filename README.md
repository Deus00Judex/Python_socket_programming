Currently used for simple message parsing between a server and multiple clients.

server.py provides the platform for a client application i.e. client.py to send messages to the server.
The messages and other events will be logged in the log.txt file.
Please note that you most likely need to change the IP and or PORT in the client.py and server.py files.
